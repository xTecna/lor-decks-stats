<h1 align="center">LoR Decks Stats</h1>

This site is as simple as it gets. Choose a .CSV file with decks from a tournament, choose the number of decks for each player according to the CSV, set an offset for unwanted data to the left and wait for it to count a tally of regions and champions for all the players at the tournament. I'll try to add some graphs in the near future.

Thank you, <strong><a href="https://github.com/renatocesarramos">AloRenato</a></strong>, for your enourmous help with the reponsiveness and layout! You're the man!
